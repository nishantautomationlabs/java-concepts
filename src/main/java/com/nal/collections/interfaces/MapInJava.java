 * Java Map is an object that maps keys to values. A map cannot contain duplicate keys:
 * Each key can map to at most one value.
 * The Java platform contains three general-purpose Map implementations: HashMap, TreeMap, and LinkedHashMap.
 * The basic operations of Map are put, get, containsKey, containsValue, size, and isEmpty.

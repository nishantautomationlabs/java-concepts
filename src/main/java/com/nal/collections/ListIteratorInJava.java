 * Created by nishant on 19/02/20.
 * An iterator for lists that allows the programmer to traverse the list in either direction,
 * modify the list during iteration, and obtain the iteratorâ€™s current position in the list.
 * Java ListIterator has no current element; its cursor position always lies between the element
 * that would be returned by a call to previous() and the element that would be returned by a call to next().
